# Franz Microsoft To-Do Plugin
A plugin that allows you to run Microsoft To-Do in [Franz](https://github.com/meetfranz).
Just add the files into your Franz plugin folder.

*Currently Microsoft seems to be experience problems on their end. When that is resolved and this plugin can be properly tested I will make a pull request to include in this in the Franz plugin repository.*

## Installation
Just copy all the files into your Franz plugin folder in a folder names `microsoft-todo`.
